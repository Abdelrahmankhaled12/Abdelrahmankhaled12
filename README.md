## âš¡ About Me :

I am a student in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, and have been learning about web design and development for the past three years. I have executed numerous designs and worked as a freelancer on various projects. I am passionate about programming and constantly strive to improve my skills and capabilities to compete effectively. I am confident that I will achieve my goals soon.

I enjoy challenging myself to learn new techniques and apply them in my projects. I love working with a team and exchanging ideas and learning from others. I am always looking to improve the user experience and make designs more attractive and user-friendly. I am interested in artificial intelligence technologies and want to apply them in web design and development. I believe that innovation and creativity are the keys to success in web design.
