## âš¡ About Me :

I am currently a computer and artificial intelligence student, and I am very interested in the web field, especially the front end. My goal is to be fully stacked, but I know very well that I need time to go from the front end to the back end, so now I am very interested in the front end, and I like to solve problems a lot, using C++ and Java script. My goals for the coming period are many. I wish I could achieve many things from them, why not all of them, but it takes time, learning and patience.
